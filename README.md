# *Local Connect(LoCo)*
A tool that connects artisans, vocational workers and professionals with those who are looking for their specific services within a local community
# LoCo - Bridging Local Talent with Service Demands
LoCo is a mobile-first platform built to help skilled individuals (artisans, freelancers, and service providers) connect directly with people who need their services.

## 🌍 Problem
Many skilled workers are unavailable offline or depend solely on personal networks, making them hard to reach. As a result, clients are forced to rely on word-of-mouth referrals. LoCo streamlines this process by offering a centralized platform for local service discovery.

## 💡 Solution

LoCo is a lightweight app where:
- **Skill Sellers** can create a verified profile using their phone number.
- **Clients** can post jobs and browse service providers nearby.
- A hyperlocal search allows users to discover nearby gigs or talents by category and location.

## 🚀 MVP Features

- Phone number + SMS authentication
- User profiles with GPS/manual location tagging
- Job posting (title, category, budget, location)
- Offline-first support (local data storage)
- Basic discovery and search filters
- Map view of nearby gigs/providers
- One-click contact via call/SMS

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
